 game_concept_KingsOfMagic_desc: "#bold Kings of Magic#! is another mod made by #P me! VecsonON#!, also known for creating series of mods names #italic Arcane Legacy#!\n\nThis time, when I got burned our from current Iteration of AL namely Arcane Legacy 4, I decided against making another Arcane Legacy mod, It seems that I will always get stuck doing nothing productive, and instead make another mod not connected to Arcane Legacy. Even though at core they both are about magic in Crusader Kings 3, they differ in many way. Most obviously, this time I decided to go with historical magical systems instead of making one myself! Hopefully this will make my burnout problem less problematic.\n\nWhere in Arcane Legacy there was a single magic system that was designed to include in itself all historical magic systems, this time there isn't a single magic system but a set of them!"
