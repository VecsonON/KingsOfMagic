Even though at core they both are about magic in Crusader Kings 3, they differ in many way. Most obviously, this time I decided to go with historical magical systems instead of making one myself! Hopefully this will make my burnout problem less problematic.\n\nWhere in Arcane Legacy there was a single magic system that was designed to include in itself all historical magic systems, this time there isn't a single magic system but a set of them!"
