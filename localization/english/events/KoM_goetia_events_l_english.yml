 KoM_goetia_events.1.t: "True Name of a Demon"
 KoM_goetia_events.1.desc: "I began, like always, in silence.\nThe candle lit, emanating small amount of light onto my parchment.\n\nThe air felt still, as if it was watching my every action.\nI placed the paper before me, completely blank; as my breath created small mist. Into that mist I whispered question: 'Not whom you are, but what am I missing to see you clearly?'\n\nThe shadow lengthened and rearranged itself into patterns, perhaps letters, though none that belonged to any script I knew. Each symbol was unreconcilable, unknowable to human mind, but it still conveyed a message, a message of curiosity and pity. When I traced them with my finger, the ink rose from the page like snake.\n\nThe last candle died, and with it parchment I used. For an moment there was no difference between light and darkness, question and answer.\nAnd in that stillness, I learned what every magus eventually does; #italic a name is not something you discover, it's something that recognizes you back.#!"

 KoM_goetia_events.2.t: "Question to the Demon"
 KoM_goetia_events.2.desc: "The circle was already drawn when I arrived, ash building beneath the lighten candles. Small incantation, and a bit of waiting; just for air to hold it's breath, as if world itself was preparing for an intruder. All because I want to know, for Demon to answer my question.\n\nThe presence came quietly, like the heat seen above campfire. It did not need a shape, a figure; my mind already gave it one, stitched from my memories and primordial fear.\n\n#italic 'Speak.'#! I said, though the word barely escaped my mouth. The reply was a thought that wasn't mine #italic 'To ask a question is to build a mirror. Are you ready to see who stands behind you?'#!\n\nThe smoke from the candles curled inward, forming the outline of a face; my own, but slightly different. I forced myself to remember, to never answer questions from beyond.\n\n#italic 'I seek guidance'#! I told it.\n\nSalience was deafening. One after another, candles slowly burned out.\n\nAs the last candle burned, I was alone once again, now with answer to my queries painted in my blood where once was their True Name."

 KoM_goetia_events.3.t: "Command to the Demon"
 KoM_goetia_events.3.desc: "It begins.\n\nThe air tightens; familiar, oppressive, stiffness seeps into the air. A sense of wrongness settles into the soul.\n\nOne by one, the candles gutter and die, each faster than the last, fleeing what is to come. From the smoke of the final flame, rising from the central wick, a shape begins to coil and twist; at first formless, then arranging itself into symbols from an alphabet no mortal tongue could name.\n\nThe shapes shift again, merging into pure concepts of despair, then into something almost human; almost, but not quite. Every feature is subtly, nauseatingly wrong.\n\n'Do what I wish' I command.\n\nNo voice answers. Yet I feel its gaze, hollow; impossible, carving itself into my soul. A silent conversation passes between us, older than any mortal language.\n\nThen, slowly, the figure unravels. The smoke folds inward, as if the moment itself were retreating into oblivion. When the last wisp fades, the final candle flares once and dies.\n\nStillness.\n\nAnd yet, I know something has changed. As the world bends under Demon's command."

 KoM_goetia_events.4.t: "Controlling the Demon"
 KoM_goetia_events.4.desc: "Everything is ready.\n\nThe candles burn in a perfect circle, their flames wavering as if uncertain. At the center lies the offering I prepared; the goat, still living, barely. Darkness all encompassing me on every side, broken only by the trembling light.\nI begin.\n\nIncantation after incantation spills from my mouth. At first, the words are mine; familiar, deliberate. But with each passing breath they twist, reshaping themselves into sounds that are no longer any human speech. Soon, I'm no longer speaking them; they're speaking through me. As always, the candles begin to die; one, then another. But this time, all of them vanish not leaving a single lit candle.I cannot stop. The voice that uses my mouth belongs to something vast and cruelly patient. The darkness swallows the room whole.\n\nAnd then, sight returns, though no light remains. A shape stands before me; humanoid, but imperfect, as though made from imperfect memory.\n\nWith shaking hand, I bare my arm, showing demon words on my hard, written in blood. 'I demand change.' The figure watches. The air thickens until breathing feels like drowning. My throat burns. Somewhere deep inside, control begins to return; slow, painful, unwanted.At last, the final syllable dies on my tongue. I fumble for the spare candle and strike a spark.\n\nLight flares.\n\nThe goat is gone.\nThe circle is smudged.\nAnd the world around me… is not the same."
